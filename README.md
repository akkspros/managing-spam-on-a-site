Spam, otherwise known as an unsolicited commercial message, or something you never asked for, trying to sell you something you don't need, happens in WordPress too. Comment Spam happens when a spammer posts comments to your website. **Why would they do this?** Most spam comments contain links to the spammer's website, Their goal, is to increase the number of back-links to their website by publishing them anywhere and everywhere they can. The hope is that the higher number of backlinks, the higher their Google Page Rank will be. In reality, Google views these types of links as low-quality backlinks and they do not help spammers, and instead will sometimes hurt Page Rank. **Why does spam hurt your site?** These spam posts can make your website look less credible, include information that you don't want your readers to see and sometimes even cause problems with your website's SEO. **Controlling**** Spam with a Plugin: **All WordPress sites should utilize some type of anti-spam plugin.
